% This follows the same basic concept as "time on target",
% in that we're comparing a subject's gaze path to stimulus-derived data,
% but here we're comparing to a heatmap of motion, which will:
% 1. include the door swinging open, and 
% 2. ignore times when no character is in motion.
% This is most closely equivalent to the "pursuit duration" metric 
% given by Roux, Passerieux, & Ramus (2013).

% This data has already been rescaled to the stim monitor size,
% and gaze was inherently sampled at the stim monitor size,
% so the two are spatially aligned, but still need to be temporally aligned.

%% SYNCHRONIZE GAZE AND POSITION
% Resample up to the frame rate of the eyetracking data
% e.g. if the video is at 60 fps but the eyetracker is at 250 Hz,
% then there are 250/60 gaze samples per video frame,
% which is non-integer 4.167
% so it's not as simple as just e.g. playing each frame twice
% Need to know what frame was up for each gaze sample,
% then resample the position data to follow that pattern.
% Row 4 of gaze is the frame number. Use that to index out of posDat.
% motionMap = posDat(:,:,gaze(4,:));
